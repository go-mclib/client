# TODO

- [ ] fix `RaycastBlocks` method (bot places items through walls, instead it should attempt to pathfind to a spot in an angle that is not obstructed by any collision shape)
- [ ] fix `needsClearAbove` logic (currently, the bot attempts to store items in obstructed chests)
- [ ] fix item frames not being recognized on containers
